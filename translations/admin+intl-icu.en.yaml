        href='https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/fr/templating.html#filtres-int-gr-s'>See
        online documentation</a> <h3>GoGoGoCarto special filters</h3>

        <h4>gogo_text</h4> Display text (with line breaks before and after the
        text)</br> You can use <b>the label option</b>: '{{ tel|gogo_text(label
        = "Phone")'}}

        <h4>gogo_date</h4> <ul>

        <li>Format a date '{{ event_date | date '}} or '{{ event_date |
        gogo_date(label="Date")

        '}}</li>
          <li>Or if you want to use a particular format '{{ event_date|date("DD/MM/YYYY")
        '}} or '{{ event_date | gogo_date(label="Date", format="DD/MM/YYYY")
        '}}. <a href='https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/'>See
        possible choices</a></li> </ul>

        <h4>gogo_tags</h4> Displays an array as tags '{{ ["Service", "White"] |
        gogo_tags '}}

        <h4>gogo_textarea</h4> Display long text, there are several options
        <ul><li><b>truncate</b>: truncate the text after XX characters (default
        1000), and put a little "show more"</li> <li><b>tolerance</b>: truncate
        tries to be at the end of a sentence or less than a word. The tolerance
        is the number of characters we give as a margin to the algorithm. i.e
        truncates to 1000 characters +/- 50</li> <li><b>glossary</b>: a glossary
        to explain certain words. The word will be slightly highlighted and on
        hovering will display the explanation</li></ul> <pre>'{{"My beautiful
        text supposedly very very long"|gogo_textarea(truncate = 15, tolerance =
        5, glossary = { "beautiful": "English word that means pretty"})

        For example, to display a field in uppercase you could do
        <b>'{{my_field_name|upper'}}</b>. Special filters for gogocarto have
        been created, they allow to simply display certain type of field. For
        example, for a long description field, we could use
        <br>'{{my_field_name_long_description|gogo_textarea(truncate = 300)
        }}</br>. This will trim the description to around 300 characters and

      nothing to do with it such as "Amap Organic" would appear in the results,
